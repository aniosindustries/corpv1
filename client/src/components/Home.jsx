//For centuries, humankind has gazed upon the stars with wonder and amazement. It is only in the last 100 years that we have seen the Earth from space, or set foot on the moon. 
//Today, we are in a time of unprecedented opportunity. New technologies are advancing at an alarming rate, and the potential for a new world is only just beginning to be realized.
//With the cost of access to space tumbling to ever historic lows, it is now possible for humankind to reach outer space with relative affordability. 
//And so, our mission is to provide access to outer space to all. 
//By providing an all-inclusive platform, the average Earth-bound citizen can access the stars, the moon, and the planets.
